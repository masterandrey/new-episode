# new-episode
Scrape data about new episodes of the serial movies you watch.

## Implementation details
I am using Python 3 with libraries:
* [Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/intro/tutorial02/) for
rapid web-ui development

## Installation

### Sentry
Error and logs in [sentry](https://docs.sentry.io/).
Overkill for the project, just for practice sake.
